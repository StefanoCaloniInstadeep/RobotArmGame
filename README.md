# Project 2: ROBOT ARM GAME

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to controll a robot arm.  


A reward is provided for each step where the tip of the arm is inside the target sphere.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to foolow as close as possible the target sphere.  

The state space has 33 dimensions.

Four conrinuos actions are available between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +20 over 100 consecutive episodes!

there are 2 variants of the environment with a single agent or with 20 agents. In the provided example we used the second one.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)


    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

1. Place the file in the course GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `RobotArm.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent!

A solution is also provided `Solution.ipynb`.

That leads to the trained agent below!
